So fun you'll feel like you're cheating!
This is an add-on mod for Pokermon - an add-on mod for Balatro.

Focusing on non-Pokemon Jokers and other features that expand the scope of gameplay.
One goal is to test concepts to potentially add to the main mod. Please give feedback in the Pokermon discord! (fan-additions Forum Channel)
